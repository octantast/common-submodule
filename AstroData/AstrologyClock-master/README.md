# Astrology Clock

Displays the time, moon phase, and current planetary positions and retrogrades in the zodiac, with additional optional indicators for the outer planets, major angles, lunar points, and Arabic parts.

Positions are displayed with the x-axis as the horizon, with the ascendant degree on the left. Regular movement goes counter-clockwise; retrograde movement goes clockwise.

The following options can be modified through the right-click context menu on the page:

* Update rate (smooth second hand motion or ticking second hand)
* Moon phases
* Horizon indicator
* Toggle indicators for:
    * Inner bodies (Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars)
    * Outer bodies (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron)
    * Lunar points (Dark Moon Lilith, Ascending Node)
    * Major angles (Ascendant, Midheaven)
    * Arabic parts (Parts of Fortune, Spirit, and Eros)
* Manual dark mode
* Automatic dark mode, which toggles dark mode on sunset and overrides the manual dark mode setting

Uses Astro font type by Cosmorama (modified to add glyphs for Parts of Spirit and Eros), as well as the Moshier Ephemeris JS fork by @0xStarcat
